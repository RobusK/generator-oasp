Application Template
=============

oasp4js offers you a template for building JavaScript client applications.

Offers more than other development "seeds"
-----
There are plenty of development "seeds" for js-based client applications, like [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) or [angularjs-seed](https://www.npmjs.org/package/angularjs-seed). All of them are great, but they focus rather on quick&easy start and work well for small-scale projects. oasp4js is built as a base for bigger, enterprise projects, where different modules are developed independently and simultaneously by many teams.

Does not reinvent the wheel
-----
The template defines a structure of an application and includes a [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) script which supports developers in their activities such as coding, testing and building the application all this based on industry proven practices.

The template integrates best-in-class frameworks and libraries as well as [oasp4js extensions](https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js).

For an example of an application making use of the template, please refer to the [sample application](https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js-sample).
