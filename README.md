Application Template
=============

oasp4js offers you a template for building JavaScript client applications.

The template defines a structure of an application and includes a [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) script which supports developers in their activities such as coding, testing and building the application all this based on industry proven practices.

The template integrates best-in-class frameworks and libraries as well as [oasp4js extensions](https://github.com/oasp/oasp4js).
